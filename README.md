A simple fitness app storing exercises with reps and sets
3 databases are used: 1 for the exercises, 1 for routines, 1 for goals.

1. The user can add custom exercises, specifying which muscle group the exercise primarily targets using the custom dictionary.
   
2. An option has been added to view any exercise that the user has created. The user can add a custom name for the exercise,
   choose the muscle group from a custom dictionary list, specify the reps and specify the sets.

4. An option has been added to delete any exercise that the user has created.

5. The user can create a workout routine from exercises saved into the db upon creation. This creates a new table for the routines.

6. An option has been added to view any workout routine that the user has created.

7. An option has been added to view the progress completed so far in a selected workout routine. It asks the user how many reps have so far been completed, automatically converting to sets if more reps than the given one set has been completed. It then displays the progress in sets and reps.

8. The Set Fitness Goal function has been added for a user to set a goal of for their total reps for a given exercise. It automatically converts the reps to sets and reps.

9. The user is also given the option to view their progress towards the specific goal set previously. Ideal for Calisthenics or other bodyweight associated exercises.

10. The user can also delete any fitness goals set.

The program has been made to rely solely on Python. Tables are printed in the terminal coherently and in an organised manner.
